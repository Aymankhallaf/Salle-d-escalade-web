Write documentation for the deployment of a web application
Deployment documentation is a crucial element in the lifecycle of a web application.It serves as a detailed guide to ensure consistent and repeatable deployment, while facilitating future maintenance and troubleshooting.

1.	Introduction
Purpose of this document
Clearly explain the purpose of this documentation. For example:
"This document provides detailed instructions for deploying, configuring and maintaining the [Application Name] web application in a production environment."

Impact
What’s covered/what’s not covered For example:
"This documentation covers web application deployment, server configuration, and basic maintenance procedures. It does not cover :
development of new features or major changes in architecture."

Target Audience
Identify who will use this documentation. For example:
"This documentation is intended for system administrators, DevOps, and developers involved in the deployment and maintenance of the application."


Reminder of the main steps of a deployment script

1.	Environment preparation  

Clone the project from /github.com/Aymankhallaf/Salle-d-escalade-web

2.	The source encoding.
●	Cloning the Git repository or uploading files
3.	Installation of dependencies
install docker 
To build images and run all containers and volumes
# LAMP ENVIRONMENT

## BUILD AND RUN

To build images and run all containers and volumes

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
4.	App configuration
  copy and edit the configuration file
5.	application build number
	Compile, minify, bundle (npm run build, etc.)
6.	Tests
●=	Unit and Integration Testing;
7.	Deployment
   Copying files to the production server
	Database update required
8.	Restart of services
	Restarting web server, Docker containers, etc.
9.	Post-deployment verification
	Tests of correct operation of the application in production
2.	Application Architecture
Architecture diagram
Include a visual diagram representing the architecture of the application. Use tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart to create a clear diagram showing:
●	Application components (frontend, backend, database)
●	Data flows,
●	External services used

Main Components
Describe in detail each major component of the application: Frontend:
●	Framework used (e.g. Laravel, React, Vue.js)
●	Dossiers Structure
●	Main dependencies Backend:
●	Language and framework (e.g. Node.js with Express, PHP with Laravel)
●	Structure of IGAD
●	Important middlewares Database:
●	Database type (e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
●	database diagram
●	Indexing and optimizations
